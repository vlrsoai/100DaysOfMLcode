**The idea is simple:**
1. Pick an industry
2. Find a Problem
3. Locate a Dataset
4. Apply AI to Data
5. Create a Solution

**DAY 0**
## Today's Progress:
✅ Step 1: Picked News Industry  

✅ Step 2: Found a Problem: Artificial Intelligence Based News Anchoring  

## Thoughts:
This idea comes as an inspiration from this video.  

The AI based **NEWS Anchoring** can sound a bit realistic in near future. 

Hopefully, we will be able to code an AI to present the **NEWS** in a different way.  

The idea is simple: We will present the AI based **NEWS** channel with computerized voice.
